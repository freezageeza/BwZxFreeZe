    <h4 style="text-align:center;">My Background</h4>
    <pre style="text-align:center;">
        I am a born and raised cambridge boy, born at addenbrookes hospital. 
        I then moved to the outskirts of cambridge in a village called linton, 
        Which has one this iconic pub still running after all these years, called the Dog n Duck.
        I visit linton still go back to every week to play football.
        I studied a national sports diploma in college when i was 16 years old then realised a year ago that i have a passion for computers.
        In the sense that i love to be behind one constantly

    <h4 style="text-align:center;">Interests</h4>
    <pre style="text-align:center;">
        Interests are in playing playing/watching football, especially any premier league games as they are all entertaining to watch.
        I also like to play video games such as: League of legends, CS:GO, Fifa & Call of duty.
        As well as these things i also like to go out and socialise with my friends, usually surrounded by alcohol. In a club on a friday night.

    <h4 style="text-align:center;">Code Nation</h4>
    <br>
    <pre style="text-align:center;">
        The reason that i joined code nation was because i saw an opportunity to change my life, away from the bartending & hospitality.
        I enjoy a challenge and as coding is a conplete new skill i am trying to learn it makes it 10x more enjoyable.
