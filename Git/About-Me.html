            i had differentiate myself from 8 other joshs and being my surname "Free" so it made sense. 
            Another thing is as you can tell by this photo left, i am a Liverpool supporter.

            I am 23 years old and currently living in cambridge in a village called Newnham which ironically is very close 
            to my work which is in a nightclub which i do part time whilst studying coding with codenation.

            My working life has been pretty much the same thing, that being bartending in various different companies. Before
            this though i was a scaffodler. Working days i didn't have college. I have been a bartender at Lola lo's Cambridge for 4 years now,
            currently a part time employee there whilst studying coding. I also spent 2 years at varsity hotel bartending, which was a complete
            change but very rewarding.
